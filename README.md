# PravasiAI 🇳🇵🤖  
**From confusion to action — anywhere you work**

PravasiAI is a **B2C AI-powered legal companion** designed for Nepali migrant workers working abroad (UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Kuwait, etc.).  
It helps workers **understand documents, know their rights, avoid legal trouble, and take correct actions** — using a combination of **AI (RAG), document analysis, and human legal support**.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Every year, **hundreds of thousands of Nepali workers** migrate abroad for employment.  
A large number of them face serious problems such as:

- Not understanding employment contracts and legal documents  
- Wage theft, delayed salary, or unfair termination  
- Passport confiscation and visa violations  
- Lack of knowledge about host-country labor laws  
- Language barriers when seeking help  
- Not knowing *where* or *how* to file complaints  

Despite these being **high-impact legal risks**, workers currently rely on:
- Verbal advice
- Informal agents
- Generic chatbots
- Overloaded embassies or NGOs  

There is **no trusted, structured, worker-first digital solution** that converts legal confusion into **clear, actionable steps**.

---

## 💡 Solution

**PravasiAI** solves this by combining:

- A **general-purpose free companion app** (so users keep it installed and trusted)
- A **premium AI-powered legal analysis system** for crisis moments
- **Verified legal advisor connectivity** when human help is required

The app ensures workers:
- Understand documents *before* signing
- Know their rights *before* problems escalate
- Take correct legal actions *at the right time*

## 🧠 Practical Use of AI (Why AI is Necessary)

PravasiAI uses AI **intentionally and responsibly**, not as a buzzword:

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
  - Retrieves verified labor laws, embassy guidelines, and country-specific rules  
  - Prevents hallucination by grounding answers in real documents  

- **Document Analysis (OCR + Rules + AI)**  
  - Scans contracts, offer letters, visas, agreements  
  - Highlights red flags, missing clauses, and risks  

- **Structured Legal Outputs**  
  - Converts raw legal text into:
    - Step-by-step action plans
    - Required documents
    - Official contacts
    - Downloadable PDF reports  

- **Voice & Language Support**  
  - Nepali ↔ English / Arabic translation  
  - Voice-based interaction for accessibility  

AI here **reduces dependency on guesswork and misinformation**, which traditional software cannot do.
